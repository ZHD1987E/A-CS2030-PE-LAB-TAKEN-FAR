# Wait, what the hell is this?

Thanks to someone who published the CS2030 Practical Examinations online, more specifically the [2024 Semester 1 Practical Examination on Seat Booking](https://russelldash332.github.io/CS2030/PA/PA1/2410/PA1_2410.html), I decided it was a simple exercise for me to try out some build tools on my own, specifically Maven.

# What's inside?

It's just a direct dump of my Maven project, which includes the following:
- Source files that answer that particular Practical Examination
- Test files that I tinker around and crash my code with thanks to JUnit
- Some random logs that I generate from testing and whatnot

# How do you use it?

Err... Probably take it as sample solution from a non-TA I guess? My code can produce wrong results.

# Credits to?

@RussellDash332 for publishing that assessment.

# I want this taken down! Or I have better ideas to write test cases!

No worries! [Write in](mailto:zhanghaodong101@outlook.com) to me, or message me on <t.me/@zhd1987e>

# Happy tinkering I guess?
